We would use a simple Agile process called Scrum, with some changes for AR (Augmented Reality) development.

    - Fast testing: AR features need to be tested often because they are new and sometimes donâ€™t work the same on every device.

    - Flexible: Scrum works in short time periods (sprints), so the team can change plans easily if something does not go well.

    - Good teamwork: The team talks every day and works together to solve problems quickly.
    
    - Early feedback: Every 2 weeks, we show what we built. This helps find problems early and improve the app.

    - Better planning: We can set clear goals for each sprint and make sure the game works well on different AR glasses.
