# AI Coding Assistant Failure Analysis

I found that most easy and medium-level programming tasks were solved correctly by the AI-assisted coding tool.
However, I encountered a failure on a more complex task related to data preprocessing when I working for my Final Thesis.
The AI-generated solution missed a subtle but important detail related to user and item ids, which led to creating incorrect test set. 
This illustrates that AI tools may struggle with context-specific requirements.
